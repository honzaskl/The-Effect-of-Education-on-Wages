This project, created by Jan Sklenička and Sebastian Černý, examines the effect of education on wages using data from the European Social Survey (ESS). To ensure accurate results, we apply:

🔹 Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
🔹 Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) to address endogeneity
🔹 White’s Robust Standard Errors to correct for heteroskedasticity

Our goal is to estimate the true impact of education on income and provide evidence-based insights for labor economics research.
